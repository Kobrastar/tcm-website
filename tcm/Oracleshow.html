                    Futaba Sakura, also known as Navi, begins her journey as a reclusive and socially withdrawn
                    teenager. Traumatized by the death of her mother, Wakaba Isshiki, Futaba lives a secluded life,
                    refusing to interact with the outside world. Her stepfather, Sojiro Sakura, supports her patiently,
                    but she struggles with deep guilt, believing herself to be the cause of her mother’s death. Despite
                    her isolation, Futaba exhibits a genius-level intellect, particularly in technology, programming,
                    and hacking. This brilliance sets her apart, even as she battles her inner demons and social
                    anxiety.

                    Futaba’s life takes a dramatic turn when she seeks the help of the Phantom Thieves to “steal her
                    heart” and help her overcome her guilt. In the Metaverse, Futaba confronts the distorted cognition
                    of her mother’s death, ultimately awakening her Persona, Necronomicon. With this newfound strength,
                    Futaba becomes Navi, the Phantom Thieves’ tactical navigator. Her unmatched skills in hacking and
                    analyzing enemy weaknesses make her an invaluable ally. By embracing her role, Futaba grows
                    emotionally, reconnects with the world, and finds a new family among the Phantom Thieves.
