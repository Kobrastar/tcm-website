                    Ryuji Sakamoto, also known as Skull, is a former track star whose life was upended by the abusive
                    actions of his coach, Kamoshida. Ryuji’s defiance against authority often labels him as a
                    troublemaker, but his anger stems from a deep sense of justice and frustration at the world’s
                    unfairness. Despite his brash and outspoken nature, he is fiercely loyal to his friends and seeks
                    redemption for his past.

                    Ryuji’s Persona, Captain Kidd, awakens during the Phantom Thieves' confrontation with Kamoshida,
                    symbolizing his rebellious resolve. As Skull, Ryuji becomes the team’s powerhouse, both in combat
                    and morale. His boldness, determination, and occasional comedic antics bring energy to the group
                    while reminding them of the importance of perseverance.
